## Project Specifications

For this project, i'll be working with the Northwind database--a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft containing data from a
fictional company. 


## The Project

The goal of this project is to query a database to get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis.
In this statistical analysis, i'll  perform a hypothesis test (or perhaps several) to answer the following question:

> Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order?
If so, at what level(s) of discount?


## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to gather information from a real-world database and use  knowledge of statistical analysis and
hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be of value to the company.
